        <p style="border:1px solid green" >My name is Ken and I'm a Rhode Island native, but left right after high school for the <b>United States Marine Corps</b>.  I was fortunate to travel the world and see many different parts of the globe.  My current job still allows me to travel some which I enjoy.  In my free time I enjoy riding and working on motorcycle, brazilian jiu jitsu, and recently discovered pickleball.
